  abstract={As blockchain technology continues to transform the realm of digital transactions, scalability has
            emerged as a critical issue. This challenge has spurred the creation of innovative solutions, particularly
            Layer 2 scalability techniques like rollups. Among these, ZK-Rollups are notable for employing ZeroKnowledge Proofs to facilitate prompt on-chain transaction verification, thereby improving scalability
            and efficiency without sacrificing security. Nevertheless, the intrinsic complexity of ZK-Rollups has
            hindered an exhaustive evaluation of their efficiency, economic impact, and performance.
            This paper offers a theoretical and empirical examination aimed at comprehending and evaluating
            ZK-Rollups, with particular attention to ZK-EVMs. We conduct a qualitative analysis to break
            down the costs linked to ZK-Rollups and scrutinize the design choices of well-known implementations.
            Confronting the inherent difficulties in benchmarking such intricate systems, we introduce a systematic
            methodology for their assessment, applying our method to two prominent ZK-Rollups: Polygon
            zkEVM and zkSync Era. Our research provides initial findings that illuminate trade-offs and areas
            for enhancement in ZK-Rollup implementations, delivering valuable insights for future research,
            development, and deployment of these systems.},

  title={Unmasking the Illusion: The Shortcomings of ``Zero-Knowledge" Rollups in Achieving Privacy},
  author={Torralba-Agell, Adrià and Keshavarzkalhori, Ghazaleh and Pérez-Solà, Cristina and Megías, David and Herrera-Joancomartí, Jordi},
  booktitle={RECSI},
  abstract={The rise of Layer 2 (L2) solutions, including Payment Channel Networks, sidechains, and rollups, has aimed to tackle the scalability challenges of Layer 1 (L1) blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Among these, Zero-Knowledge Rollups (ZK-Rollups) have emerged as a compelling solution by utilizing zkSNARKs to bundle multiple transactions, thereby enhancing throughput and reducing costs. However, despite their technical sophistication, ZK-Rollups do not inherently provide transaction privacy, a common misconception given the ``Zero-Knowledge" nomenclature. This paper explores the privacy limitations of ZK-Rollups, emphasizing the need for privacy-preserving features that align with the expectations set by their name. We also review the strategies being developed by various projects to address these limitations.
Furthermore, we propose the community begin adapting other names for the technology, such as ``Verifiable Rollup" (verRollup), ``Incrementally Verifiable Computation Rollup" (ivcRollup), or ``Succinct Rollup" (sucRollup) that better represent the current capabilities of rollups. This work contributes to the ongoing discussion on achieving a balance between efficiency, scalability, and privacy in blockchain technologies.},

  booktitle={RECSI},
  abstract={Since the creation of Bitcoin, back in 2009, many
            other cryptocurrencies have appear, and its usage has been
            growing year after year. With this huge popularity, doubts about
            the ability of blockchains to become worldwide payment systems
            (or even universal mediums for general decentralised systems)
            begin to arise and, with them, solutions started to be explored.
            In this paper we first explain the blockchain scalability problem
            and then present a brief review and a comparison among some of
            the state-of-the-art techniques that are used to scale blockchains
            on Layer 2 (or off-chain), analysing properties related to their
            Usability, Security and Cost.},

  abstract={Multivariate hierarchical data has an important role in many applications. 
            To find the best visualisation that best fits a concrete data is crucial to explore and understand 
            the relationships between the data. This paper proposes a categorisation – Elongated and Compact – of hierarchical 
            data based on the inner shapes of the hierarchies, that is the connectivity degree of the internal nodes, the number 
            of nodes, etc, that can be applied to any hierarchical data. Based on this taxonomy, we explore implicit and explicit 
            layouts – Tree, Circle Packing, Force and Radial – to provide users with a complete view of the data. We hypothesise that 
            Tree and Circle Packing fit with Elongated structures, and Force and Radial fit with Compact ones. In addition, we cluster 
            multivariate features to embed them in the hierarchical layouts. Especially, we propose two different glyphs –one-by-one and 
            all-in-one, and we bet for the one-by-one glyphs as the most suitable for showing the distribution of several features along with 
            the hierarchical structures. To validate our hypotheses, we conducted a user study with 35 participants using a hate speech 
            annotated corpus. This corpus comes from 4359 comments posted in online Spanish newspapers. The results indicated that users 
            preferred the Tree layout over the other three layouts (Circle, Force, Radial) with both types of structures (EC and CC). 
            However, when we focused the analysis only on Radial and Force layouts, both of them scored significantly higher with Compact 
            than with Elongated data. Moreover, participants scored the one-by-one glyph higher than the all-in-one glyph, but the difference 
            was not significant.},

            of different areas in our daily life. The RecSys ACM conference is the most important conference in the recommendation 
            area and every year they organise a competition: the RecSys Challenge. The work presented here aims to solve the RecSys 2021 
            Challenge which consists of giving a probability to two Twitter users that interact. In this project we have worked in the 
            development of a model which uses the power of Gradient Boosting Trees to combine multiple hand-crafted features in an aim to 
            represent the interaction between the users. Our team reached the 14th place in the overall challenge leaderboard and is placed 
            between the 7th and the 9th place in terms of Like overall performance.},

            In this project we describe both the local and global theory of the different orbits of holomorphic functions,

            development of an interactive application, made with Unity, that allows us to visualise fractals on the complex plane 
            -rendered using the aforementioned algorithms- and a generalisation of them over a 3-dimensional space, directly on a website.},
